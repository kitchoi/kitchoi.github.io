About Me
---

My name is **Kit** Yan Choi.  I am currently a PhD candidate at [Princeton University](http://www.princeton.edu)'s [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program](http://www.princeton.edu/aos).  I chose the subject mainly because I enjoy studying Physics and programming.  Studying climate science makes sure I do lots of these.  I am also from the Food Paradise Hong Kong.  Living abroad makes me cook the food that I would otherwise never try to make it myself.


I also post code snippets in [blog](/blog.html).  Hope they would be helpful for others and myself in the future.
