title: About Me
---

My name is **Kit** Yan Choi.  I am currently a PhD candidate at [Princeton University](http://www.princeton.edu)'s [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program](http://www.princeton.edu/aos).  I chose the subject mainly because I enjoy studying Physics and programming.  Studying climate science makes sure I do lots of programming.  I am also from the Food Paradise Hong Kong.  Living abroad makes me cook the food that I would never learn how to make.


I posted here some [code snippets](/programming.html) that might be helpful for others and myself in the future.  I also included [food recipes](/recipes.html) as I often modify/average multiple recipes I found online and then forget later what I have done.
