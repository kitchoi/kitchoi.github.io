Size of container/cake: 1.25L
Serve 4-5 people

Ingredients:
(Modified from [Christine's recipes](http://en.christinesrecipes.com/2009/01/chinese-new-year-turnip-cake.html?m=1))
<!--start-excerpt-->
- 1 kg Turnip/Daikon (weight after grating)
- 170gm rice flour
- 4 Tbsp corn starch
- 2 Chinese sausages<!--end-excerpt-->
- 5 slices of western bacon or ideally chinese bacon
- 2 Tbsp of dried shrimps
- 1 clove of spring onion or shallot
- 3/4 cup of chicken broth
- white pepper to taste

Methods:

1. Use a grater or a peeler to grate the turnip into fine strips, add the chicken broth and chopped spring onion.  Bring it to boil.  Cook until turnip becomes translucent.

2. Dice the bacon and sausages, add dried shrimp and cook them in a pan.

3. Drain the turnip and add them to the meat.  Mix well.

4. Remove the pan from heat.  At the same time, mix the corn starch and rice flour in a separate bowl.

5. Add the flour and starch to the turnip-meat-mix bit by bit, mix well and add water when necessary.  The batter should be thick but you should be able to stir the mix with little force.

6. Grease your container before putting the batter in.

7. Steam the cake for 1-2 hours.  Insert a chopstick into the cake, if it comes out clean then it is cooked.

8. Let the cake cool in a fridge for hours or overnight.  The cake should come out strong.

9. Cut the cake into slices and fry them.  Serve with hoisin sauce or osyter sauce or soy sauce.


Note:
Adding too much onion or meat may stop the batter from blending together to make a smooth and strong cake.
