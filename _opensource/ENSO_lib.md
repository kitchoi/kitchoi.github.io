This is a python library for diagnosing El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and analysing their characteristics.

Here are a few of the functions of this library:

* Identify ENSO events using an SST anomaly index
* Composite a physical variable for an El Nino or a La Nina event
* Compute the ENSO asymmetries in terms of amplitude, duration and transition preferences ([Choi et al. 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00045.1))
* Simulate ENSO SST anomalies under a conceptual framework with or without nonlinear air-sea coupling ([Choi et al. 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00045.1))
* Diagnostics for the maximum zonal wind response to ENSO taking into account varying spatial structures
* Statistical analysis for the spatial structure of ITCZ and SPCZ rainbands
